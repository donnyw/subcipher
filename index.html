    <span class="ciphertext" id="c1"> Secret Message: When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. 
      My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the 
      mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This 
      is the day of the reaping. I prop myself up on one elbow. There's enough light in the bedroom to 
      see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother's body, their 
      cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. 
      Prim's face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother 
      was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.
    </span>

    <span class="ciphertext" id="c2"> Secret Message: Eventually I understood this would 
      only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my 
      tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask 
      so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work 
      quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public 
      market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which 
      is the black market where I make most of my money. 
      Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid 
      discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food 
      shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to 
      repeat my words and then where would we be?

    <span class="ciphertext" id="c3">
      Secret Message: Betrayal. That's the first thing I feel, which is ludicrous. 
      For there to be betrayal, there would have had to been 
      trust first. Between Peeta and me. And trust has not 
      been part of the agreement. We're tributes. But the boy 
      who risked a beating to give me bread, the one who 
      steadied me in the chariot, who covered for me with the 
      redheaded Avox girl, who insisted Haymitch know my 
      hunting skills . . . was there some part of me that 
      couldn't help trusting him? On the other hand, I'm relieved that we can stop the 
      pretense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin 
      connection we'd foolishly formed has been severed. And 
      high time, too.

    <span class="ciphertext" id="c4">
      I've ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice 
      Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for 
      my father's death and then yesterday to say my final 
      goodbyes to my friends and family. But that's a dark and 
      creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour 
      milk. The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so 
      that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink 
      to ants as you shoot up into the air. It's exhilarating and 
      I'm tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again, 
      but somehow that seems childish.

    <span class="ciphertext" id="c5"> We're whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake 
      Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. The opening 
      ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being 
      loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horses. Ours 
      are coal black. The animals are so well trained, no one 
      even needs to guide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct 
      us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our capes, before moving off to 
      consult with each other.

    <span class="ciphertext" id="c6">The survey missions of MMVs fall in two main areas of 
      application, to a large extent overlapping. The first is data 
      collection for the population or the updating of a road cadaster 
      database or a urban GIS; in this case geometric and attribute 
      data about the road infrastructure but also about its 
      surroundings area of interest are collected. The second, 
      normally of interest to road and traffic departments which are 
      responsible for road maintenance and road safety, concentrates 
      more on the state of the road surface (frequency and severity of 
      potholes, cracks, degree of surface roughness).
